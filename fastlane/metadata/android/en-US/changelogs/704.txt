What's new:
* Add local wallpapers directories.
  * Note very large directories may take some time to load.
* Use added local directories for auto wallpaper.
* Backup and restore settings, favorites, and saved searches.
  * Note that permissions to access local wallpapers are lost on a re-install, so any local wallpapers marked as favorite won't be restored.
* View all open source libraries used in the app in the "More" screen.
